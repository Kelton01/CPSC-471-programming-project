DESIGN PROTOCOL:

1.Commands that are inputed by the user at the client would be sent to the server. Client will begin preparing the corresponding functions.
2.Server receives the command and prepares the correspoding functions to either receive or send data.
3.The sender and receiver now establish a data connection.
4.The sender will send the file name and the file size over the data connection. Each would have a buffer of 1024 bytes.
5.The receiver receives these messages and prepares to receive the file.
6.Sender would add “EOF” to the end of the file being sent.
7.When the receiver receives “EOF”, it will stop receiving data and would decode the file.
8.We avoid overflow by only sending packets with a maximum size of 1024.
  a.The receiver would only receive packets of maximum size of 1024 until finished.
